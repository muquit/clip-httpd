## Release v1.0.1
This is the initial public release of clip-httpd, a simple, secure, and 
cross-platform clipboard server. This tool is designed to bridge the gap 
between your remote command-line environments and your local desktop, 
making it easy to copy text from any machine directly to your system's 
clipboard
